# System for Converting Numbers Between Bases

This project presents a distributed system to convert numbers from one base to another by implementing a Java remote method invocation system. With this system, a client can send a number to a server along with its base and choose to convert it to another base.This system ensures the validation of input data by allowing positive numbers and bases. Also, it effectively deals with remote exceptions to provide a powerful user interface.

# Features:
Converts numbers between different bases.
Validates the input values (positive numbers and bases).
Handles remote method invocation exceptions.

# Technologies Used
Java.
Java RM.
